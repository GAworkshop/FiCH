**To install**

1.  Download the plugin file
2.  Unzip the file into a folder on your hard drive

**Standard WP/WPMS (for blog by blog access)**

1.  Upload the membership folder and all it contents to /wp-content/plugins folder on your site
2.  The path to the main plugin file is wp-content/plugins/membership/membership.php

**To activate it on a blog by blog basis**

1.  Log into the blog dashboard that you want to set up membership on.
2.  Go to Plugins > Installed
3.  Click on Activate under Membership lite system

**Enabling your membership plugin**
By default, the membership plugin is disabled when first installed and when you go your Membership Dashboard you will see it says Disabled.

You need to leave this as disabled until you have at least:

1.  Set up your categories
2.  Created and activated a basic level to use for strangers
3.  Assigned the stranger level in Membership > Edit Options panel

If you are running a live site and enable the plugin in your Membership dashboard all content will be automatically protected until you have set up the stranger level.

**The Admin user**
The membership system can initially be administered by the admin user and is always disabled on the front end of your site for this user, you can add other users to the membership administration group by editing them in WordPress and ticking the Membership admin box at the bottom of the User Edit page.
